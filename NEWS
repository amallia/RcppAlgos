RcppAlgos 2.0.3 (Release date: 2018-07-02)

* Corrected clang UBSAN error identified by two different unit tests. In both situations, the problem was occurring as a result of populating a vector of integers with values from a vector of doubles that contained a nan (Not-a-Number). Most information was obtained from Brian J. Knaus's blog titled : "Reproducing a clang-UBSAN issue" (https://knausb.github.io/2017/06/reproducing-a-clang-ubsan-issue/)

RcppAlgos 2.0.2 (Release date: 2018-06-15)

* Corrected divide by zero in divisorsRcpp unit test.

RcppAlgos 2.0.1 (Release date: 2018-06-10)

* Corrected spelling in DESCRIPTION

RcppAlgos 2.0.0 (Release date: Never Released)

* Changed max value and explicitly casted a few values to (int64_t) in PollardRho.cpp for efficiency while still maintaining accuracy from 2^60 to 2^62 (isPrimeRcpp is roughly 10% faster now).
* Updated core permutation algorithm for greater efficiency and generality
* Added capability of generating specific combinations/permutations
* Changed arguments to comboGeneral/permuteGeneral. rowCap is now upper.
* Added comboSample, permuteSample, comboCount, and permuteCount
* Fixed bug with numDivisorSieve and divisorSieve when the lower bound was greater than 1 and less than the sqrt of the upper bound. In the previous version, the numbers in this range would have duplicated values/counts.
* Increased efficiency of numDivisorSieve by a factor of 2.
* Updated unit tests for greater coverage. See the function package_coverage from the package 'covr'.


RcppAlgos 1.0.1 (Release date: 2018-03-09)

* Corrected precision limits in documentation from 2^64 to 2^63.
* Changed const type in PollardRho.cpp from (int64_t) to (double) to correct "UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer"
* Changed examples in primeFactorizeSieve to reduce check time
* Added RcppAlgos-package man file.


RcppAlgos 1.0.0 (Release date: 2018-03-07)

* Added the following functions: primeFactorize (vectorized pollard rho factorization), divisorsRcpp (vectorized factoring (complete)), isPrimeRcpp (vectorized primality testing using Miller-Rabin algorithm), & primeCount (based on the primecount algorithm by Kim Walisch)
* Completely revamped the primeSieve function. It is now a segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with wheel factorization based on primesieve by Kim Walisch.
* Renamed divisorsList to divisorsSieve (reason for the major version update to 1.0.0)
* Renamed primeFactorizationList to primeFactorizeSieve
* Made the sieving functions more flexible. They are now able to generate results over a range and can also produce named objects.
* All number theoretic functions have been made more efficient. Some make use of the fast integer division library 'libdivide' by ridiculousfish.


RcppAlgos 0.2.5 (Release date: 2018-01-04)

* Added unit tests.
* Removed unnecessary files.
* Fixed bug in primeSieve that occurred when a number with a decimal was passed (e.g. 2.01).
* Adjusted accepted lower bound for numDivisorSieve, eulerPhiSieve, divisorsList, primeSieve, and primeFactorizationList.
* Fixed bug when non-unique elements are present with factors.


RcppAlgos 0.2.4 (Release date: 2017-12-18)

* Fixed bug that occurs when non-unique elements are present for combinations with replacement.


RcppAlgos 0.2.3 (Release date: 2017-12-18)

* Fixed segmentation fault error highlighted by valgrind check in version 0.2.2.
* Updated DESCRIPTION file.


RcppAlgos 0.2.2 (Release date: 2017-12-15)

* Fixed bug in constraint functions that occurred when m = 1 and the constraint limit was equal to the last element in v. It was returning a 2x1 matrix with the same value twice.  It is now correctly returning a 1x1 matrix with the correct value 1 time.
* Reorganized source code such that all utility functions for the combinatoric functions are now in their own file. Additionally added header for this file.
* All combinatoric functions can now utilize the rowCap argument. Before, rowCap only applied to the combinatorial functions with constraints.
* comboGeneral can now find all combinations of multisets.
* Both comboGeneral and permuteGeneral can utilize the argument m when dealing with multisets.  Before, permuteGeneral would simply return all permutations of a multiset. Now you can specify the lengths of the output.


RcppAlgos 0.2.1 (Release date: 2017-11-29)

* Fixed bug that would occur in two edge cases involving the constraint functions.
* Slightly modified formatting for primeSieve.Rd


RcppAlgos 0.2.0 (Release date: 2017-11-28)

* Updated combination algorithms. They are now more than twice as fast.
* Updated constraint functions so that memory access is always within container bounds
* Consolidated redundant code for outputting different Rcpp types (e.g. IntegerMatrix, CharacterMatrix, etc.) via a templated approach.
* Added the function permuteGeneral that is analogous to comboGeneral only instead of combinations, it gives all permutations. It has an additional argument (i.e. 'freqs') that is used to generate permutations of multisets.
* All combinatoric functions now support factor types.


RcppAlgos 0.1.2 (Release date: 2017-11-03)

* Corrected minor typo in README file.
* Fixed minor error regarding explicitly comparing variables to large numbers that are typed out. Simply adding a decimal along with a zero remedies the situation.


RcppAlgos 0.1.1 (Release date: 2017-11-03)

* Improved ComboConstraint function by removing unnecessary subsetting.
* Improved PrimeSieve internal C++ algorithm.
* Corrected the errors with respect to the math functions in C++. Explicitly overloaded the parameters of these functions by casting them to the double type.


RcppAlgos 0.1.0 (Release date: 2017-10-26)

* Initial Release
